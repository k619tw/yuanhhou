        <div class="title">Moovie  </div>
        is a movie-booking application that allows users to transact their movie tickets with their own individual mobile payment in a faster way securely. Also, the application enables users to purchase multiple movie tickets for their friends; this allows the users to share the electronic movie stub which indicates the movie title, date, and the theatre on social media.
    </h3>
    <h3> Due to COVID-19, I worked the whole project independently in terms of the user experience research and the user interface design. 
    Throughout four months of study, I was able to collaborate with five interviewees from The University of Queensland regarding their experience of movie booking application, 
    researching through three UX evaluation including Co-Design method in Low-fidelity prototype evaluation, System Usability Scale (SUS) in Medium-fidelity prototype evaluation, 
    and Technology Acceptance Model (TAM) in High-fidelity prototype evaluation. </h3>
    <h3> In response to the user interface of Moovie, I have implemented some design principles and HCI theories, including Gestalt psychology, 
    Fitts’ law, and Hick’s law in the hope of making the intuitive and accessible interface.</h3>

    <h4>The brief was originally given to improve the transaction experience through the interactive systems, attempting to design  these interactions so that people can engage with them, making sense of them and using them effectively. </h4>
    <h4>
         To delve into the research on what obstacles people may encounter regarding the transaction during the time they are using the movie-booking application, I have interviewed the end-users for receiving the insightful feedback. The majority of interviewees have mentioned that 
        <div class="highlight">compared to mainstream products or platforms nowadays, typing their credit card information on a relatively untrustful application makes them feel the sense of insecurity.  </div>
    </h4>
    <h4>To address the identified issues, I established and researched the conceptual design, including the problem statement,  interaction mode, metaphors,  design guideline from Material Design and Human Interface guideline, and the system requirements. From the visual components to user experience design, the user interface and user experience have positively revised through the three rounds of design iteration. </h4>

    <h4>The user flows above showcases what the user will experience when purchasing the movie tickets on Moovie. As the usability and accessibility are two most pivotal factors when assessing whether the product is usable and intuitive, the prototype has heavily followed the colour consistency and design theories, such as Hicks’ law, Fitts’ law, and Gestalt principles [1]. </h4>
    <h4>Also, the user flow process has simplified in the hope of making the users minimise the memory load and potential confusion of the interface. From the home page, the user would be able to check the most available time when the movie starts. If a user wants to check the movie information from the list of movie cards, Moovie would display the nearest movie theatre, and seat selection by only making a few steps. This links back to the UX goals where the participants mentioned their pain points of the current existing application. </h4>

    <h4>Throughout the SUS method in medium-fidelity prototype evaluation, the result has shown that the usability and accessibility do not reach the user experience sweet spot. The participants have mentioned error prevention, aesthetics, and the ambiguous user journey when selecting the number of people before choosing the movie. Nevertheless, the users cannot associate with the movie stub icon as the signifier is not clear enough. The colour and border-radius are not consistent so that the users may have a negative experience when using the application. </h4>
    <h4>With the participants' insightful feedback, I leveraged the opportunity to revise and redesign the user map and the design elements. Through the TAM method I used in  High-fidelity prototype evaluation, the accessibility of the application has significantly improved since the score of "Perceived ease-of-use" are reached to the highest score. Additionally, regarding the usefulness of the application, the responses have shown that the application is believed to improve the application's UX goals, proving that both accessibility and usability have enhanced due to the changing user journey. </h4>
    <h4>To sum up, throughout the evaluation, the usability, user accessibility, UX goals, and the user interface, Moovie has enhanced its user experience at each stage. However, the prototype undoubtedly needs to do more evaluation cycle since some usability problems still exist and these will not addressed radically, meaning that there is no perfect design for the Human-Computer Interaction since people are varied. Different people have different perceptions and goals when using the application. </h4>
