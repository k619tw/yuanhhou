      h5 Paper Prototype | Design Thinking 
      p
        | This video was made while I was studying Design Thinking at The University of Queensland in Brisbane, Australia. I was asked to design a paper prototype to illustrate on how to design site-specific technologies that promote certain people to collectively experience the campus as enchanted. Since I noticed the food court has the overcrowded issue, I designed a real-time seat availability system and the light availablity system that is similar to vehicle detection sensors.

        | This video was made while I was working as a digital designer at Shih-Chien University in Taipei, Taiwan. This video is aimed to catch the first-year students' attention in joining the annual English-taught camp COOL CAMP. Ultimately, this video has successfully invited more than thirty people attending the five-day activity. Asides from creating the video, I also made the camp T-shirts and poster prior to the camp starts.

      h5 Video Editing 
      p
        |  I was given the brief that I have to redesign a video that is previously made. I can only use the original clip to edit the video; any external videos are not allowed in the work. In short, make a completely fake story from multiple clips. 
        | One classical aesthetic element I applied is in the first footage- the scenery shot. It is one of the essential movie editing skills, and it often appears in a successful movie. When we want to change or start in a new scene, the first step is taking the scenery shot. It is used to introduce the environmental background, explaining the time, and pushing the story plot. It helps the audience to culminate their emotion. Therefore, in the first footage, I use a scenery shot deliberately instead of cutting to the chase to present the main plot.

      h5 Culture Manifesto - Stop Labelling 
      p
        | I made this clip while I was studying Emerging Digital Cultures at RMIT University. I was asked to produce a manifesto in responding to the issues across the course. I chose Xenofeminism in this task since Xenofeminism is promoting the idea of "Gender Abolitionism", which partly match the Queer culture as queer is the term for someone who does not want to box in their orientation or gender by "labelling" it. Through the ideas above, I urged we should get rid of terms such as lesbian, gay, bisexual since these terms are actually labelling them. I intended to use an unclear voice since I do not want audiences to know what gender is the speaker. Therefore, I used Reaper, an audio editing software, to transform the frequency of the voice.

      h5 Sound Design - Storytelling with sounds
      p
        | The video was made while I was studying sound design at RMIT University. In this video, I applied sound techniques like diegetic sound and non-diegetic sounds, using Reaper to adjust the frequency of sound, creating a sense of emotion by adjusting the pan and the volume in Reaper. More importantly, I have learnt how to use the misappropriate sound to make the audience buy the connection between the visual and the sound.
